Selecting species
=================

You can chose between three manually curated databases to reference your
genes:

1.  Gene Ontology
2.  Reactome
3.  KEGG

Available species differ between three options. The most exhaustive is
KEGG database, because KEGG pathways are downloaded on the fly, while
annotations for GO and Reactome are stored locally on the server via
Bioconductor Annotation Databases.

To find a specie of interes in KEGG database you can use text field
above the KEGG dropdown menu using a string from any scientific notation:
