Example data
===================

Package DOSE from Bioconductor provides an example dataset  which was derived from R package breastCancerMAINZ that contained 200 samples, including 29 samples in grade I, 136 samples in grade II and 35 samples in grade III. Data contain logarithm (base 2) of ratios of geometric means of grade III samples versus geometric means of grade I samples. 

Sample data contain two features:

numeric vector: fold change or other type of numerical variable

named vector: every number was named by the corresponding gene ID

The selectedGenes contains genes with logRatio>2
